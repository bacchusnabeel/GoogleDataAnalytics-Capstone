##How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success
This project is the Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics course. I followed the Google Data Analytics workflow that will be shown below

#Ask
-Question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
-Compare and contrast Members and Casual riders to drive business decisions that would cater to the respective rider.

#Prepare
-[Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
-[License](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)
-Public data that is used in this fictional setting. Safe to assume the data is credible
-This data allows us to separate the casual and member riders so that we may compare their start and end time, as well as where and when they ride. 
-No filtering and data is sorted by start time. 

#Process
-Used Excel for 12 months of 2021
-Removed rows with duplicate ride_id which are unique values
-Created ride_length variable which is the end_time minus the start_time of the ride
-Created day_of_week variable that shows what day(Sunday through Saturday) the ride took place. Uses the start_time.

#Analyze and Share
-Check the CaseStudy1_Report for full details.

#Act
-Increase advertising to Casual riders from March to September.
-Increase advertising of Classic Bike and Electric Bike to the Casual and Member riders or reduce focus on Docked Bikes.
-Create program that promotes consistent bike usage. This would reward members and encourage casuals to ride more.
